---------------------------------------Here We Can Discuss Our Plans!--------------------------------------------

***************************         ARMAAN      ********************
Okay so the main plan behind this web app is to let users post stories and and other users can also read stories made by other peoples
and they can even like and share other's stories 

but we arent allowing users to comment on other's post
And i think we can use cookies to save stories as draft in the browser and we will wait untill the users presses the publish button

//Date: 18th August 2020
    The current progress is that i have started to work on the backend API and added the post option so that users can post their stories
    and we are even validating the request on the server side and as for the proxy we gonna use CORS so that Vue can integrate with the backend API
    and i have even asked VV for collaboration! Hope he accepts it lol dunno what he gonna say XD ugh and as for the database modelling
    its pretty much done for the story part i can say only the user's schema is yet to make and shit i have my classes today lets see how am i gonna
    work things up UwU Hope this project is gonna be a good one cause previously i just left that one becuase i wanted to learn data science and stuffs
    at that time lets see how it goes

    by the way this txt file is just to plan stuffs up and i dont thik i will be commiting this up i will add this to my gitignore file UwU and yeah
    i can use this as my personal diary or so for this project lol but most importantly i am gonna use this thing for planning and logging stuffs up!


PS: Dunno he gonna accept it or not but yeah i am making a slot for him lol! oof bbye i have my classes i am gonna commit this thing real quick! UwU
